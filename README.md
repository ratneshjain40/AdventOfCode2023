## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles designed by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). It consists of daily challenges, each focusing on a particular problem-solving aspect. The puzzles are released one per day, starting on December 1st and ending on December 25th.

For more information, visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in Rust. Each day's solution is organized in a separate folder with a dedicated README file explaining the problem and my approach to solving it.

## Usage

To run any specific day's solution, navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions provided in the README file.

```bash
cd AdventOfCode2023
cargo run
```

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a consistent folder structure:

- **days:** Folder all challenge.
  - **day_X** Solved tasks for that day
    - **task_1.rs**: This file contains the code for task 1. It is written in Rust and demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts such as variables, control structures, and functions.
    - **task_2.rs**: This file contains the code for task 2. It builds upon the concepts introduced in task 1 and introduces extra complexity.
    - **input.txt**: Input data for the challenge.
    - **README.md**: Detailed explanation of the problem and my approach.

- [src/main.rs]: Rust source file containing the solution code.
